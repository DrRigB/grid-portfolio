                <p>Summary: Healthhive.guru was a website that me and a team of three others put together for our BPA (business professionals of America) project. The website is up and you can visit it at healthhive.guru. When building it I worked on some front end, I built the backend using Django, and published it through heroku.</p>

                <p>Summary: I built this to build a little tool and to learn more about AI. I implemented an openai API key to read the video after it was scraped to summarize it then put it to audio. This was helpful to learn quite a bit about AI in genral. I built it in python and in visual studio code. It isnt a full fledged website but maybe oneday I will make it one. Overall a really fun project</p>
